# HAI 2020 Annual Report

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/bc17d46e-b46f-4c89-b476-89cbe562e198/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/hai-2020-annual-report/deploys)

This repo contains a Netlify-hosted static website for the HAI 2020 Annual Report. The site is hosted under SWS's Netlify account.

**IMPORTANT:** The [2021 Annual Report site](https://github.com/SU-SWS/hai-2021-annual-report) has been launched, replacing the 2020 Annual Report on the live Stanford URL: http://hai-annual-report.stanford.edu/ . However, since HAI wants past reports to remain available, this site is still active on the Netlify URL and linked to from HAI's main website.

Netlify URL: https://hai-2020-annual-report.netlify.app

The repo was built off [SU-SWS/assets_stanford_edu](https://github.com/SU-SWS/assets_stanford_edu)
